# WeePager

A simple, funny and fully customizable pager for iOS. Wee!


## Installation
At the moment the library is in my personal pod repo.
Add this to your Podfile
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/FedeGens/FedeGensPodSpecs.git'
```
And add this too.
```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'WeePager'
```
Alternatively you can just import the classes from this repo

##Requirements
- iOS 8.0+ 
- Swift 3.0

## How to use

###Initialize WeePager

##### Storyboard
- Drag a UIView inside your UIViewController
- Set WeePager as your View Class
- Link an outlet on your UIViewController

##### Programmatically

```Swift
let yourWeePager = WeePager()
yourWeePager.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: yourWidth, height: yourHeight)
self.view.addsubview(yourWeePager)
```

###Set your pages

```Swift

var vcArr = [UIViewController]()
for i in 0...20 {
    let vc = UIViewController()
    vc.title = "page " + String(i)
    vcArr.append(vc)
}
yourWeePager.set(viewControllers: [UIViewController()], titles: nil, images: nil)
```
Create a **UIViewController array** and call "set" method to set your pages!
Pages titles are obtained from **UIViewController().title**. If you want you can create a **String array** and pass it as "titles" parameter, or use an **UIImage array** as "images" parameter to set images instead of texts.

**Easy, isn't it? ;D**

###Customization

Here we are! We have fully initialized our pager with a few lines of code. And now? **Personalize it!**
